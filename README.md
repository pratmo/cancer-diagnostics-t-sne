### cancer-diagnostics-t-sne

This is an analysis of the Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) DataSet, obtained from Kaggle. This data set was created by Dr. William H. Wolberg, physician at the University Of Wisconsin Hospital at Madison, Wisconsin,USA. To create the dataset Dr. Wolberg used fluid samples, taken from patients with body masses. We use t-SNE to see if we can identify the similar patterns in the data.

**Dataset Information:**

ID number 2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) 3-32)
*Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:*

radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)

texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)

perimeter

area

smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)

compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)

concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)

concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)

symmetry

fractal dimension (“coastline approximation” - 1)
